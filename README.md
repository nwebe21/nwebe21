👋 Hi there! I’m Junanine Olay

A Full-Stack Web Developer passionate about crafting clean, scalable, and purposeful web applications.

I love turning ideas into working software — whether that means squashing a tricky bug, optimizing a slow query, or bringing a new feature to life with a smooth UI and solid backend logic. I believe great code is not just about functionality, but also about clarity, maintainability, and collaboration.
